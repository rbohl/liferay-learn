# Maintenance Versions

Fix Packs are released on a periodic basis and include bug and security fixes. If you are installing a fix pack to an installation that has custom code deployed, we recommend that you deploy and test the fix pack with your custom code on a test environment prior to installing on production.

See [Patching Liferay](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/7.x/en/installation-and-upgrades/maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/patching-liferay.html) and [Understanding Patch Types](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/7.x/en/installation-and-upgrades/maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/understanding-patch-types.html) to learn about the various types of patches.

To learn how to apply a patch, see [Installing Patches](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/7.x/en/installation-and-upgrades/maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/installing-patches.html).

Liferay Commerce 3.0 (open source) users have access to the same bug and security updates through new releases of Liferay Portal 7.3.

## Updating Liferay Commerce 2.1 and Below

Periodically, Liferay will release updates (maintenance versions) to Liferay Commerce for both open source and enterprise subscribers. In particular, Maintenance Versions refer to the change in the third digit of the version number. Each maintenance version includes the latest bug fixes and provides an improved level of security and reliability. Customizations are generally safe, but reviewing the customizations are highly recommended before implementation.

Updating to a new maintenance version is very similar to upgrading to a new major or minor version of Liferay Commerce.
