# Introduction to Order Workflows

This article explains _Order Workflows_ and gives an overview of the order workflow options available.

_Order Workflows_ are a site-specific setting that, if enabled, require the buyer or seller to give internal prior approval for an order before it can be [processed](../orders/processing-an-order.md).

**Figure 1**. [Order Life Cycle](../orders/order-life-cycle.md) with both _Approval Workflow_ and _Transmission Workflow_.

With two _Order Workflows_ to choose from, _Approval Workflow_ and _Transmission Workflow_, there are four order workflow options available out-of-the-box.

## No Order Workflows

If no order workflows are enabled, buyers simply proceed from open cart to placed order, and sellers simply [review _Pending_ orders](../orders/processing-an-order.md), advance the orders to _Transmitted_ and [fulfill them](../shipments/introduction-to-shipments.md).

## Approval Workflow (Buyer-Side Cart Approval) Only

If _Approval Workflow_ is enabled, the _Checkout_ button in the mini-cart is replaced with a _Submit_ button, indicating that the buyer must submit the cart for internal review and approval prior to beginning checkout. Once approved, the rest of the [order life cycle](../orders/order-life-cycle.md) (order placed, order transmitted, [order fulfilled](../shipments/introduction-to-shipments.md)) takes place as normal.

## Transmission Workflow (Seller-Side Order Approval) Only

If _Transmission Workflow_ is enabled, going from open cart to order placed happens as normal. However, when the _Pending_ order arrives at the seller, he must review the _Pending_ order and either approve it or reject it (sending it back to the buyer) prior to [advancing the order](../orders/processing-an-order.md). Once the order is approved, the rest of the [order life cycle](../orders/order-life-cycle.md) (order transmitted, [order fulfilled](../shipments/introduction-to-shipments.md)) moves forward as normal.

## Both Approval Workflow and Transmission Workflow Order Workflows

If both _Approval Workflow_ and _Transmission Workflow_ are enabled, then the additional steps from both _Order Workflows_ are present.
