<!-- This table is OK for starters but each of these fields has "Basic", "Advanced", and in some cases "Autocomplete" configurations. We need to document those as well eventually.  -->
<!-- This table was worse to read than the help center content, right from the start. And now I have to reformat it so I can add details. This was abuse of tables before I exploded it. -->

| Form Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Paragraph** | This is static text on the form. Users do not enter data into form text fields. The form creator enters text that form users see displayed on the form. This is useful for longer instructions. |
| **Text Field** | Users enter text into these fields. For example, a Full Name field is a text field. By default, a text field keeps all input on a single line of text. To accommodate longer responses, choose the multi-line setting when configuring the text field [as in this example](./creating-forms.md). You can put limits on the text users can enter (e.g., numbers from 1-10, email addresses, etc.) by using the text field's [validation options](./validating-text-and-numeric-field-entries.md). |
| **Select from List** | Users select one option (or more, if configured to allow it) from a list of choices. Choices are entered manually or are automatically populated by a data provider. For example, a Country of Residence field can be selected from list field populated by a Countries of the World data provider.
| **Single Selection** | Using a radio button, users select one option from a list of options displayed on the form.|
| **Date** |  Users select a date using a date picker. |
| **Multiple Selection** | Users select one or more options from check boxes (or toggles, if configured). |
| **Grid** | Using radio buttons, users select from options laid out in rows and columns. One selection can be made per row. This is useful when the same response metric is needed for multiple questions. |
| **Numeric** |  Users enter numeric data (integers or decimals) into numeric fields. Non-number input is not accepted. |
| **Upload** | Users can select a file from the Documents and Media library or upload a file from their local file systems. |
| **Image** | Users can select an image file from the Documents and Media library or upload an image file from their local file systems. |
| **Color** | Users can select a color from the color picker, or enter a hex code. The hex code is stored by the Forms backend. |
| **Rich Text** | Users can enter Rich Text content. |
