# Adding Organizations to Accounts

Organizations can be added to an Account to simplify the management and administration of accounts. To learn more about using Organizations with Accounts see [Using Organizations to Create a Sales Network](./using-organizations-to-create-a-sales-network.md).

There are two ways to add an existing organization to an account: 1) using the _Account Management_ widget and 2) through the _Control Panel_. Access to the _Control Panel_ is typically restricted to those with administrative permissions for the store or installation.

## Using the Account Management Widget

1. Click the left Navigation Menu → _Account Management_.
1. Click on an account (for example _South Bay Auto Parts Distributors_).
1. Click the _Add Organizations_ button.
