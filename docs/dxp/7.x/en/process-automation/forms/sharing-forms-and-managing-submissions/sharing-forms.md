# Sharing Forms

There are two ways to share a form:

* Placing the _Form_ widget on a site page and configuring the widget to display the particular form. This allows the form to be seen and submitted by any user who has access to the [site page](../../../site-building/creating-pages/understanding-pages/understanding-pages.md).
* Sharing the dedicated form URL directly with users. This limits access to the form to only those users who have the direct link.

## Displaying a Form on a Site Page

1. Navigate to the site page (for example, _Contact Us_).
1. Click the _Add_ button.
1. Click _Widgets_ then _Collaboration_ to expand the menu.

1. Close the _Form Configuration_ window.

## Getting the Direct URL to a Form

You must first publish a form before you can get a shareable link. Otherwise, you might see this warning message:

Once the form is published, a banner containing its link appears briefly:

![The form link is shown in a banner when you click the Publish button.](./sharing-forms/images/08.png)

To get the link after the banner disappears, or share the form's link by email, click the _Share_ button.

You can copy the URL or configure an email to send to relevant recipients. Users who click on the link receive direct access to just the form.
