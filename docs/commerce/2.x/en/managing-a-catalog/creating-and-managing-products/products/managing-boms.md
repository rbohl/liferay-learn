# Managing BOMs

> Subscribers

Bill of Materials (BOM) diagrams identify component parts belonging to a product. Users can create and annotate BOM diagrams in Liferay Commerce that reference products in the store. BOM diagrams can then be displayed on a site page.

BOM diagrams are comprised of two parts: the Diagram and Mapped Products.

## Adding a New BOM Diagram

To add a new BOM diagram:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Products_.
1. Click _BOM_.

    ![BOM Admin menu](./managing-boms/images/01.png)

1. Click Add (![Add Icon](../../../images/icon-add.png)) then _Add Definition_.
1. Click _Select File_ or drag and drop the product image.
1. Enter a name for the product (Generic Diesel Engine).
1. Click _Save_.

## Mapping Products to a BOM Diagram

1. Click the _Entries_ tab.

1. The _Mapped Products_ pane on the right lists all subparts. When users hover the mouse over the diagram, a plus sign appears.

    ![BOM Entries tab](./managing-boms/images/03.png)

1. Click on the part of the diagram that is associated with product (for example, _Fuel Injector 1_).

1. Enter the following:

    * **Number**: 1 (numeric ordering of the mapped product list)
    * **Product**: MIN59999 (the product name or SKU)

      ```tip::
         Text auto-complete will show suggestions as you type in the name of a product.
      ```

    ![Begin associating products in the BOM diagram.](./managing-boms/images/04.png)

1. Click _Save_.

Continue adding the rest of the products. Each entry must have a unique numeric identifier in the list of Mapped Products, even if there is more than one of the same product. In this example, there are two fuel injectors and both have a distinct product mapping number.
