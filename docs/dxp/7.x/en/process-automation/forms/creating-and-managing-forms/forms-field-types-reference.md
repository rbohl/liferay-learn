## Form Fields and Elements

### Paragraph 

This is static text on the form. Users do not enter data into form text fields. The form creator enters text that form users see displayed on the form. This is useful for longer instructions.

### Text Field 

Users enter text into these fields. For example, a Full Name field is a text field. By default, a text field keeps all input on a single line of text. To accommodate longer responses, choose the multi-line setting when configuring the text field [as in this example](./creating-forms.md). You can put limits on the text users can enter (e.g., numbers from 1-10, email addresses, etc.) by using the text field's [validation options](./validating-text-and-numeric-field-entries.md).

Users select one option (or more, if configured to allow it) from a list of choices. Choices are entered manually or are automatically populated by a data provider. For example, a Country of Residence field can be selected from list field populated by a Countries of the World data provide
