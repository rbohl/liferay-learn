# Portal Properties

All the configurations that DXP requires to run out-of-the-box are specified using *Portal Properties*. The properties are a set of name/value pairs that DXP reads from properties files on server startup. The property defaults are specified in the DXP installation's `portal-impl.jar/portal.properties` file. The [Portal Properties](https://docs.liferay.com/dxp/portal/7.2-latest/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html) reference lists all of the properties and includes descriptions, example values, and default values.

While some properties can be changed through the user interface (UI) once application server startup completes, other properties must be changed in a properties file before the server is started. Some examples of configurations that _must_ be done through a properties file include but are not limited to: connecting to a database, declaring the location of the [`[Liferay Home]`](./liferay-home.md) folder, changing how users authenticate (by screen name instead of by email address), and increasing the size limit for file uploads.

```warning::
   Never directly modify the portal-impl.jar/portal.properties file; rather, use another properties file (an extension file) to override properties you want to change. The typical extension file to create is called portal-ext.properties, in your `[Liferay Home] <./liferay-home.md>`_ or [USER_HOME] folder.
```

Using Portal Properties to configure a DXP installation is the most common and recommended method of configuring Liferay DXP and also provides the following benefits:

* A single configuration file that can be easily distributed to other Liferay DXP environments and server nodes.
* The ability to check configurations into a version control system to simplify configuration management.
* Setting all your custom properties in a file before initial startup is the quickest way to configure DXP.

## Using Portal Properties

`[Liferay Home]/portal-ext.properties` is the most common extension file to use. If there is no `portal-ext.properties` file and you apply changes using the Setup Wizard, DXP sets those properties in a file called `portal-setup-wizard.properties`.

Here are a few examples of configurations that can be set in a `portal.properties` file.

### Setting a Database Connection

Database connection properties are most commonly set in a `portal-ext.properties` file. If you want to change the database connection, for example, create a `portal-ext.properties` file and set the [database connection properties](./database-templates.md) to the values you want:

```properties
jdbc.default.driverClassName=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
jdbc.default.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/lportal?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useFastDateParsing=false
jdbc.default.username=joe.bloggs
jdbc.default.password=123456
```

For more database configuration details, see [Database Configurations](./database-configurations.md) and [Database Templates](./database-templates.md).

### Setting the Location of Liferay Home

Some application servers (e.g., WebLogic) require customizing the [Liferay Home](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028831932-Installing-Liferay-DXP-on-WebLogic-12c-R2) location before deploying the DXP WAR file. The [`liferay.home`](https://docs.liferay.com/dxp/portal/7.2-latest/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html#Liferay%20Home) property lets you set the location.

```properties
liferay.home=/home/jbloggs/liferay
```

### Changing How Users Authenticate

To change how users authenticate to your Liferay DXP server the following to your `portal-ext.properties` file.

```properties
company.security.auth.type=emailAddress
#company.security.auth.type=screenName
#company.security.auth.type=userId
```

## Configuration Priority

There are nuances to configuring Liferay where some configurations can be set in multiples places - whether in the multiple portal properties files or the UI.

### Portal Properties Load Order

It is possible to create and deploy multiple Portal Properties override files at a time. In this circumstance, Liferay DXP will prioritize the order in which the property values are read and applied with `1.` taking highest priority:

1. `${Liferay Home}/portal-setup-wizard.properties`
1. `${USER_HOME}/portal-setup-wizard.properties`
1. `${Liferay Home}/portal-ext.properties`
1. `${USER_HOME}/portal-ext.properties`
1. `${Liferay Home}/portal-bundle.properties`
1. `${USER_HOME}/portal-bundle.properties`
1. `${Liferay Home}/portal.properties`
1. `portal-impl.jar/portal.properties`

This ordering itself can be changed and configured by setting DXP's [`include-and-override`](https://docs.liferay.com/dxp/portal/7.2-latest/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html#Properties%20Override) portal property. Note that if a properties file specifies a value for a portal property and includes another properties file that also specifies a value for the same portal property, the value in the included properties value takes precedence. For example, suppose that a `portal-ext.properties` specifies `module.framework.properties.osgi.console=localhost:11312` and also specifies `include-and-override=portal-developer.properties`. And suppose that the `portal-developer.properties` files specifies `module.framework.properties.osgi.console=localhost:11311`. In this case, `module.framework.properties.osgi.console=localhost:11311` will be applied since this is the value in the *included* properties file.

```note::
   We recommend using as few properties files as necessary to simplify configuration management for a DXP installation.
```

### UI Configuration and Portal Properties

Some Portal Properties are available to change as [System Settings](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029131591-System-Settings), at *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* or in `.config` files. These properties are stored in the DXP database. The SAML authentication properties, for example, are Portal Properties available in System Settings.

```important::
   Properties set in the UI are prioritized over properties set in Portal Properties files.
```
