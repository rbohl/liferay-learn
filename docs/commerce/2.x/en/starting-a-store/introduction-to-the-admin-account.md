# Introduction to the Admin Account

The Admin user is created by default in any new installation of Liferay Commerce and has full permissions to modify every facet of a Liferay Commerce instance. The Admin user can create, modify, and delete sites, pages, users, accounts, catalogs and products, and perform all store and site administrative tasks.

## Accessing Liferay Commerce as the Admin User

1. Open a browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
1. Click the _Sign In_ link.
