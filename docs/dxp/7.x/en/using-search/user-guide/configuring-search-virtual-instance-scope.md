# Configuring Search: Virtual Instance Scope

The entries in Control Panel &rarr; Search Tuning are scoped to the Virtual Instance:

**Result Rankings:** Customize search results manually by hiding, pinning, and adding results for specific aliases. See [here](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034473872-Search-Tuning-Customizing-Search-Results) for more information.

**Synonyms:** Create synonym sets so that synonymous search terms are matched and scored like an exact match to the search term. See [here](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034473852-Search-Tuning-Synonym-Sets) for more information.

> Many widgets are backed by widget templates. The default template for these can be set at the instance scope: [see the article on the widget scoped configuration for the details](./configuring-search-widget-scope#setting-system-and-instance-scoped-widget-defaults).
