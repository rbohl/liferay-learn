# Order Information

Administrators can view and edit order information by clicking an order in the [Orders Menu](./orders-menu-reference-guide.md).

There are five tabs: General, Payments, Shipments, Notes, and Emails.

## General

You can manage and track the order's status from start to finish on the _General_ tab.
