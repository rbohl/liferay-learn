# Cancelling a Shipment

If a buyer cancels [an order](../orders/processing-an-order.md) before it is shipped, the seller may cancel the shipment in Liferay Commerce. Note that cancelling a shipment does **not** close an order. Managing an order's status is done on the _Orders_ menu in the Control Panel.

To cancel a shipment:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Shipments_.
2. Click the _3-dot icon_ next to the shipment to be canceled (for example, _42498_).

3. Click _Delete_.
4. Click _OK_ in the confirmation window.

The shipment has been canceled.

Canceling a shipment changes the status in the _Transmitted_ tab in the _Orders_ menu.

Note that if a new shipment is created from the same order, a new shipment number is generated (for example, _42888_).
