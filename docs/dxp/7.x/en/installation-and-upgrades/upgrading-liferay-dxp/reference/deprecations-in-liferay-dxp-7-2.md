# Deprecations in Liferay DXP 7.2

Liferay DXP will sometimes stop developing or archive features with new versions. In DXP 7.2, Liferay has deprecated several apps and features.

Features in Liferay DXP that have been deprecated may still be present either in the core product, or as a [Marketplace download](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace). Deprecated features may be archived in a future release. Archived apps are no longer maintained or released with new versions of Liferay DXP.

```note::
   All applications deprecated by Liferay are no longer in active development. You should therefore plan to stop using these applications.
```

Features deprecated in earlier versions of Liferay DXP may also need to be considered, if you are upgrading from an earlier version than 7.1. See the following deprecations for any versions between your version pre-upgrade and 7.2:

* [Liferay DXP 7.1](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018403151-Digital-Experience-Platform-7-1-Deprecated-and-Removed-Items)
* [Liferay DXP 7.0](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018123832-Digital-Experience-Platform-7-0-Deprecated-and-Removed-Items)

Security vulnerabilities persist with NTLM. NTLM has been deprecated and removed from the bundle, but you can still [build and deploy the module](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/7.2.x/modules/apps/portal-security-sso-ntlm).

## Applications in Maintenance Mode

Although no action is immediately necessary, you may also want to consider applications that are put into maintenance mode in DXP 7.2. These applications are not being deprecated or archived, but will no longer receive updates other than bug fixes. See [Features in Maintenance Mode](./features-in-maintenance-mode.md) for more information.
